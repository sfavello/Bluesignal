## About the Project

Blue Signal is a social media full stack website designed to help people with manifestation. It takes on the idea of vision boards by taking an image via your own or from a website where you can title, describe, and post, as if the picture within is already your reality. An example image is below where you can see a picture of a kitchen, titled, "My Kitchen".

I started with the name, Blue Signal. Signal lights in most countries are green for "go", but that wasn't always the case in Japan. Hundred of years ago, Japan only had names for four colors, black, blue, white, and red. The japanese word for blue is "Ao" and often this was the word used for the color green as well. From blue apples to blue bamboo, everything that was green was named "Blue", until of course, "Midori" came into view. But still, if you're ever in Japan, you'll find yourself asking for blue apples when looking for granny smith green apples. When I read about this, it reminded me that not all ways to take a leap of faith or "going" for what you want is always clear. Sometimes you need a signal and sometimes that signal might be blue. 

## Main Focus

My main focus for this project was to become better with Tailwind, React, and Sanity. This was the most amount of files I've worked with and I wanted to prove to myself that I can handle the complexity that this design layout required. React hooks quickly proved to be my main struggle and that was the biggest takeaway from this project. I learned how to add functionality while utilizing react's hooks, specifically useState and useEffect. Learning how things worked together and seperately, similar to the cogs of a machine, I learned how and why things worked within the program and got better at writing code that gave me the outcome I wanted. 

## Created with:

* HTML
* TAILWIND CSS
* JavaScript
* React 

## Roadmap 

1. I'd like to create journal entries similar to daily affirmations for user's to stay positive and consistent with their goals.
2. I would like to create the ability for one to delete or edit their comments after posting.
3. I would also like to include more add more organizational details, specifically creating categories within a person's saved and created images.
